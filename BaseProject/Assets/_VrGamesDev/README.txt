Thank you for downloading the DDuA package.

The Unity Asset Store policy requires that all packages provide basic local
documentation, which is what you will find in the:
Assets/_VrGamesDev/DDuA/Documentation folder.

1) You need to install the following packages before using this package:
a.- Unity Addressable Asset system
b.- Unity Remote Config
c.- Standard Assets

2) You can learn how to install them and custom them in your own products
reading the file "DDuA - Tutorial and Examples.pdf"

3) To use the API, unzip the files and open the index.html in a regular browser

However, we strongly suggest using the online manual, which is more complete
and always up-to-date. The PDF documentation is rarely updated.
You can check the current documentation online at:
